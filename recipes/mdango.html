    <h2><strong><em>Description</em></strong></h2>
    <hr size="10">
    <p> Mitarashi Dango was originated from the Kamo Mitarashi Tea House in Kyoto. 
        The dango was thought to be made as an offering for gods and the name was given 
        after the bubbles of the mitarashi (御手洗) (font of purifying water placed at the
        entrance of a shrine) of a famous shrine in the city. The street vendors in Kyoto 
        started selling dango as a snack and became popular amongst many visitors. Today 
        you can find Mitarashi Dango being sold at supermarkets, convenience stores and specialty
         sweet shops everywhere in Japan.

                <li>2 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
                <li>150 ml water (measure ⅔ cup and remove 2 tsp to be precise)</li>

    <h2><strong><em>Steps</em></strong></h2>
    <hr size="10">
    <ul>
        <li> Gather all the ingredients. Joshinko and shiratamako are pictured on the left and dangoko is pictured on the right. Whichever you decide to use, the instructions below are the same. </li>
        <li> Gather the ingredients for the sweet soy glaze. Soak the skewers in water. You can start boiling a large pot of water on low heat  </li>
        <li>To Make the Rice Dumplings</li>
            <ol>
                <li>Combine the shiratamako and joshinko in a bowl (or add just dangoko in a bowl).</li>
                <li>Stir in the warm water (or the cold water for the dangoko) a little bit at a time while mixing with chopsticks. Please note: It is possible that you may need less or more water depending on the climate where you live. I live in a dry climate, so I may use more water than you.</li>
                <li>The flours will start to stick together and eventually form clumps. Using your hands, combine the dough into one ball.</li>
                <li> until the dough becomes smooth. The texture is like squeezing an "earlobe" (that's how we describe the tenderness of this type of mochi in Japanese).</li>
                <li>Form the dough into a ball. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces.</li>
                <li>Then divide each piece into 2 smaller pieces. You will have 16 equal-sized pieces of dough. I always like to weigh mine. Each ball should be 20 grams. You may have some extra dough, but that’s okay.</li>
                <li>Shape each of the dough pieces into a smooth, round ball. If the dough is cracking or has some wrinkles, dip the tip of your finger in water and apply a small amount of water to the cracked area to smooth it out. You now have 16 equal-sized dumplings.</li>
                <li>Just before cooking the dumplings, prepare a bowl of iced water. Once the water in the pot is boiling, gently drop each dumpling into the pot with a smooth, continuous arm motion. We want to cook them all at once, while keeping their round shapes. Stir the balls occasionally so they don’t stick to the bottom of the pot.</li>
                <li>The dumplings will stay near the bottom of the pot at first, but they will float once they are cooked. When they rise to the top, boil them for an additional 1-2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dumplings to the bowl of iced water.</li>
                <li>Once the dumplings have cooled, drain them well and transfer them to a tray. Tip: Wet the tray so the dumplings don't stick</li>
                <li> Skewer three pieces onto a bamboo skewer. Continue with the rest of the dumplings and set aside.</li>
                <li>To Make the Sweet Soy Glaze</li>
           </ol>
           <li>To Make the Sweet Soy Glaze</li>
           <ol>
            <li>Combine all the ingredients in a saucepan without turning on the heat.</li>
            <li>The potato starch/cornstarch will become lumpy if you heat the sauce without stirring it beforehand, so mix all the ingredients together first. Then, turn on the heat and continue to whisk.</li>
            <li>Keep whisking continuously, as the mixture can become thick suddenly.</li>
            <li>When the sauce becomes thick, remove the saucepan from the heat and transfer the sauce to a container or bowl. If you are making this sauce ahead of time, remove it from the heat before the consistency gets too thick because the moisture will evaporate and thicken the sauce as it cools. </li>
            
        </ol>
        <li>To Serve</li>
              <ol>
                <li>Optional: If you have a kitchen torch, you can give the Mitarashi Dango a little bit of char for a grilled taste. You can also grill them over direct heat (if you are going to place them on a wire rack, grease it first, as the dumplings tend to stick). You can use a broiler to char the dumplings or use a nonstick frying pan to pan-fry the surface of the dango. </li>
                <li>Pour the sweet soy glaze on top and serve immediately.</li>
              </ol>
        

            </ul>
