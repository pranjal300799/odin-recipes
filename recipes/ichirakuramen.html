   <h2><strong><em>About the recipe</em></strong></h2>
   <hr size="10">
   <p >Miso ramen is a Japanese noodle soup with a broth seasoned with miso and served with 
    a variety of vegetables and garnishes. The miso broth recipe for this dish is made from a combination of 
    the chicken base, ground pork, and vegetables, while the noodles are fresh, premade Chinese-style chukamen
     noodles that cook quickly and taste quite good. </p>
   <p>Some garnishes you may want to offer alongside the ramen include chopped green onion, hard-boiled egg (or soy sauce egg also known as 
    shoyu tamago), fish cake (kamaboko) slices, roasted white sesame seeds, pickled bamboo shoots (menma), kikurage wood ear mushrooms, and boiled spinach.</p>
